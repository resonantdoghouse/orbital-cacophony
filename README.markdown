# Orbital Cacophony: CodePen Circle Challenge  ♫
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Onomicon/pen/vbprGR](https://codepen.io/Onomicon/pen/vbprGR).

 I started by trying to scale planet distance and size based on rough realistic measurements e.g. km converted to 'mini' pixels. 
However this ended up being a fools errand and I started discovering some happy accidents. Then added some Web Audio API and the result is a Cacophony of Code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
